# IO_HS

Here is a copy of my first ever Haskell program. The program was built for educational purposes and therefore, I thought I should share it with the world. 

Type declarations in Haskell are optional: the compiler figures them out automatically, and only complains if they differ from what you've specified. The following program refers to these specific topics and covers some simple IO syntax and the concept of a Monad in functional programming.

### Contributions

I would like to thank Prof. Kevin Hammond of the University of St Andrews for his clear explanation of a Monad, Lecturer Edwin Brady from the University of St Andrews for his clear and helpful diagrams. It was about time I moved away from using the famous Burrito analogy.
