# "Hello, Oliver!"

Here is a copy of my first ever Haskell program. The program was built for educational purposes and therefore, I thought I should share it with the world. 

"Type declarations in Haskell are open and accessible: the GHC figures and identifies type declarations automatically, and only throws errors if the type declaration is different from what's been declared." - The following program refers to these specific topics and covers some simple IO syntax and the concept of a Monad in functional programming.

### Contributions

I would like to thank Prof. Kevin Hammond of the University of St Andrews for his clear explanation of a Monad, Lecturer Edwin Brady from the University of St Andrews for his clear and helpful diagrams. It was about time I moved away from using the famous Burrito analogy.
